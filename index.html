    <h1>Shift Click - Project</h1>
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hello I'm Azlee, and this is my project website for the Shift Click 
      'Introduction to Coding' course.</p>
    <p>I have previously worked as a musician and sound engineer and now, 
      due to loss of work to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am looking to transition into a 
      career as a software engineer.
    </p>
    <p>I have previous experience working with code in musical and artistic contexts, 
      working with software such as Max/MSP, Pure Data and Processing for various
      projects for gigs and art galleries. From these experiences I have developed a
      love for the process of software development - deconstructing a vision
      down into programmable elements and then progressively building these elements up into
      the final work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently training as a full-stack web developer. So far I have a grounding
      in HTML, CSS, and Javascipt. I am comfortable using technologies such as VS Code,
      Github and the command-line terminal.
